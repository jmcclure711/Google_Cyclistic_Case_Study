# Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study
## Intro
The final course of the Google Data Analytics course is a capstone project which you can choose the path you would like to take. I will be documenting the analysis and visualization process that I undergo to solve the Cyclistic case study.
## Background
- Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company out of Chicago which is home to almost 6,000 bikes and 700 docking stations. Bikes are able to be checked out of one station and returned to any other station.
- They currently offer bikes for three different ride purchase types - single-ride, full-day pass and annual memberships with two different customer types - casual and member.
- The Director of Marketing has tasked the Marketing Analytics team to figure out how to convert casual riders to annual members.
